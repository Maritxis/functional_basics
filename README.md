# functional_basics
Code implemented at the justCoding meetup on march 14th 2019. These are bascic examples of how to use functional programming in js.

These are examples for running at a node console. So if you want to execute them first you must have node installed. Then, run:
```
    node curry.js
```
Where ```curry.js``` can be any of the exercise files names.
